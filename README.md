Hello, 

I am Patsianotakis Charalampos and I am an Undergraduate student of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of University of Thessaly.
In this repository I have all the projects I made for course CE430 "Laboratory of Digital Systems".

All my projects are written in Verilog HDL language and are FPGA-proven on Spartan3 and Spartan3E.

Teacher of this course is Associate Professor Christos Sotiriou
and teacher assistants Nikos Sketopoulos and Stavros Simoglou.
